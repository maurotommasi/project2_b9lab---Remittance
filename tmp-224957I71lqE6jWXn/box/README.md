UPDATE 2021/01/11
1) Working with Visual Studio Code and having a DAPPS shared folder with Vagrant, I have this tmp...../box folder
2) Web part not over yet.
3) Inheritance Test (it's not a test of Inheritance but Composition) has inside some file.sol inside where, and here I don't know if it's correct or not, I create a new Istance of other Contract. This cause I want that Stoppable can be run only from Remittance and so on. It works when I create he Istance and send variables to the istance itself.
